                                    Eventhogh it is quite famous for tea, Sri lankan tea manufacturers do not export their tea to all the countries in the world.
                                    and the number of countries that get the sri lankan tea are not much.That where S.L.T.V(Sri Lankan Tea Vendor) comes in.

                                     <p> Sri lanka became popular for it's tea after the british inavasion in Sri Lanka. After Spending some time on Sri lanka
                                                     the british grew different types of crops such as cocoa, coffee etc but they were not much of a hit compared to tea.
                                                     the central province of Sri Lanka had the best soil,climate and geography for growing for tea and Sri Lanka took the global
                                                     tea market by the Storm. Now in 2020 long after Brtish empire fell, Sri lanka still holds one of the main places in global tea market.
