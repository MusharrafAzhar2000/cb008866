             Tea are processed two ways. One is CTC Method, the Other is Orthodox Method. In the CTC Method. Tea leaves are 
             cut, torn and curled into small bits using machinery. This method is used for tea which are then packed into tea bags.
             This method is very effiecient when tea is being processed at large quantities. This method gives dark Strong brew
             in a small interval But after the CTC method tea loses most of it's aroma. 
          </p>
            
          <p>   
             In the Orthodox Method , Tea leaves are handled delicately to minimize the breakage. These tea leaves are not cut or torn.
             They are carefully rolled so the tea doesn't lose it's flavor or aroma. 
          </p><br>

              So Tea which are processed using Orthodox method are considered high-quality tea. Try to avoid loose tea that are processed
             using CTC method. They are less flavorful and they might have lost most of their aroma.

              if the tea leaf feels light and feels dusty when you touch it maybe the tea is old. If the tea leaf breaks or crumbles 
              easilyit may be because it is overdried. If your tea tends to get damaged even after gentle handling it maybe because the tea is not good
              quality.

            Tea has a distinct aroma despite the type of tea.If your tea leaves has only a slight smell it maybe because it is low quality or old.
           Every tea type has a smell of it's own. White tea and black tea has a earthy floral smell, Green tea has a smell similar to freshly 
           cut grass.

         <p> This Might not be a surprise but high quality tea will have good taste but, we will try to get to what kind of taste
              you should expect. Regardless of what type of tea you are drinking, Every tea will have an excellent taste if they
              are good quality. high-quality White and black tea has a rich, intense taste. While green tea and oolong tea has a refreshing
              smooth flavor.When Drinking tea try as much as you can to embrace the flavor. Don't gulp it down in one sip even if it's tempting.
